### 2.1.1. Argument Passing

### 3.1.2. Strings
String literals can span multiple lines.
Two or more string literals next to each other are automatically concatenated.
### 3.1.3. Lists
You can also add new items at the end of the list, by using the append() method

## 3.2. First Steps Towards Programming
The keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with a different string:

## 4.2. for Statements
If you need to modify the sequence you are iterating over while inside the loop
(for example to duplicate selected items),
it is recommended that you first make a copy.
Iterating over a sequence does not implicitly make a copy.
The slice notation makes this especially convenient

4.3. The range() Function
The given end point is never part of the generated sequence;
range(10) generates 10 values,
the legal indices for items of a sequence of length 10.
It is possible to let the range start at another number,
or to specify a different increment
(even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’):

## 4.5. pass Statements
required syntactically
for creating minimal classes
a place-holder

## 4.6. Defining Functions
This value can be assigned to another name which can then also be used as a function
